  <p class="w3-large">Growing up the first thing my father said to me before giving me my very first laptop as a young child was, “never tell anyone your name, age, or where you live”. It was a mantra that was repeated by everyone I knew but I never really took it seriously. 
    As young as I was the very first thing I did was play purble place and became entranced with the colors, games, and puzzles. 
    At that age, my laptop gave me the freedom and imagination that I needed as I wasn't able to go out as much as I wanted to. Then when I grew up a little I discovered Disney’s own ‘Toontown’ the very first massively multiplayer online role-playing game I ever played. 
    Toontown opened my eyes in more ways than one, I got to make friends and play with people from all over the world from the comfort of my own home. 
    Just my laptop and I. The thought of it excited me as a young child, but when I thought back to the warnings everyone gave me about the internet I thought they were all wrong. 
    The internet surely couldn’t be a bad place if I got to make amazing friends and have a blast playing online. 
    The complexities and nuances of the internet did not hit me until later on in my years. Still, my first experiences of me in Toontown allowed my introverted self to become a friendly bubbly extrovert version of myself online. 
    The way I presented myself in that game dictated how I presented myself in other multiplayer games, I didn’t lie but I was a lot more open, honest, and free in my online persona than I was offline. 
    User experience is my field of study because previously I was a computer science major but felt it was lacking for me as I put a lot of work into building up a passion for it, the education surrounding computer science isn't very creative, accessible, or even inclusive. 
    I've always had a love for the internet as it is the medium I can freely express myself, meet life changing friends and be my most authentic self. 
    Computer science just wasn't the field I wanted to be on anymore when a close friend of mine introduced me to the world of user experience, she is a UX product manager but witnessing her achievements in technology as well as creativity really inspired me to do more research about this field and want to engage in it deeply. 
    I recently completed the CUNY DesignWorks program and feel confident and thoroughly educated on the different career paths UX has to offer as well as the processes most product managers and designers go through. 
    Now that DesignWorks has concluded I am ready to continue pursuing UX through a degree that better reflects my passion and career goals as an aspiring UX designer.
